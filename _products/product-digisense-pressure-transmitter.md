We are offering an high-end quality of Digital Pressure Gauge / Transmitter to our clients.
We offer M1 Series ‘Digimacks’ Versatile Pressure Instrument, which is a microcontroller based digital pressure gauge that can be used to directly measure Pressure.
Differential and Absolute Pressure Gauge which support pressure up to 200 mm wc.
The pressure output is displayed in selectable engineering unit of mm wc, cm wc, in wc, Pa, Kpa.
The M1 Series has been designed using the latest technology to provide reliable accuracy, using extremely stable Micro Electro Mechanical Sensor to give a standard full scale accuracy of 1%.
The compact design makes the unit easy to install in the industry and serves as an excellent alternative to existing mechanical gauges.
Pressure measurement can be displayed on a large, easy to read backlight LCD display, which also indicates alarm set points and range overflow condition.
