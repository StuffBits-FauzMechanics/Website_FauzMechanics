FAUZ MECHANICS Introduces S1 Series ‘Digimacks’ Versatile Pressure Transmitter, which is a micro controller based digital pressure instrument that can be used to directly measure Pressure.
Differential and Absolute Pressure Gauge which support pressure up to 100 mm wc
The pressure output is displayed in selectable engineering unit of mm Wc and Pa.

The S1 Series has been designed using the latest technology to provide reliable accuracy, using extremely stable Micro Electro Mechanical Sensor to give a standard full scale accuracy of 0.5%.
The compact design makes the unit easy to install in the industry and serves as an excellent alternative to existing mechanical gauges.

Pressure measurement can be displayed on a large, easy to read Seven Segment LED display, which also indicates alarm set points and range overflow condition.
